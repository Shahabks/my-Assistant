## This package measures readability of a written document, and helps one shorten a long written document and to extract key words for better comprehension. 
Let's measure how close our writing style is to the audience comprehension levek. Demand for concise writing is increasing, 
while we need to convey our entire stories. 
To hold the balnce, this package evaluates the readability of written documents and provides a summary of them too. 
The readability scores in this approach correlates with reading difficulty but they are noisy. 
Compounding that fact, many programs that calculate these scores rely on unclear, inconsistent and possibly inaccurate algorithms to count words
, sentences and syllables and determine whether a word is on Dale-Chall's easy word list (for a discussion, see Sirco, 2007). 
Moreover, features of the text—particularly full stops used in abbreviations and decimals in numbers—frequently underestimate average words 
per sentence and syllables per word.
